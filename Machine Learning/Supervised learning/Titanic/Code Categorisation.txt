This code is an example of machine learning, specifically supervised learning, as it involves using labeled data (the Titanic dataset) to train models that can make predictions.

Here's a brief breakdown:

Data preprocessing: This includes loading the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and selecting features and targets. This is a crucial part of any machine learning workflow.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): This includes visualizing the data with pair plots and examining the correlation matrix. EDA is used to understand the structure and characteristics of your data.

Model training and evaluation: This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting a model to the training data, making predictions on the test data, and evaluating the accuracy of those predictions. Two different models are used here: Linear Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes.

So, the overall category of this code would be "Supervised Learning in Machine Learning", and it involves aspects of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training/evaluation.
