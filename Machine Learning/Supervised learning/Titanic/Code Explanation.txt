This script should perform all the steps you mentioned. It first loads the data, handles missing values, encodes categorical features, splits the data into features (X) and the target (y), and visualizes the data with pair plots and a correlation matrix. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, fits a Linear Regression and a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to the training data, and evaluates the accuracy of both models using the test data.
